Create links to profiles from 170+ social networks

== Description ==

### The easiest way to add social links to:
* Add links to social networks in user profiles.
* Display links to social networks in a widget, in general.
* Display user cards in profile.
* Display user info box on a single post type. You'll have to place this code somewhere: `do_action( 'zsp:author_info' );`
* Display user info on author page. You'll have to place this code somewhere: `do_action( 'zsp:author_info' );`.

### Some key features:
Regarding the previous points here are some additional notes.
1. Two advanced widgets: Author box and Networks list.
1. Sortable links. You add the links to different social networks and you have the possibility to sort them using a drag-n-drop interface.
1. Multiple styles: different shapes, colors, sizes, list style, etc.
1. A large set of settings for user info boxes.
1. More, more, more.... You have to install it. ;)
